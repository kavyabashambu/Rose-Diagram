# Rose-Diagram
Rose diagram is a circular histogram plot which displays directional data and the frequency of each class.

This project represents Florence Nightingale's visualization. The code here has been written in processing and two diagrams are produced here. One is regular version of the diagram and the other is a repositioned, zoomed and rotated version of the same Florence Nightingale's visualization.
