# Rose-Diagram
Rose diagram is a circular histogram plot which displays directional data and the frequency of each class.

This project consits of 2 versions of Nightingales visualization. One version is the normal view of the visualization and the other version is a repositioned, rotated and zoomed version of the same Nightingales visualization. The code available in the docx file can be straight away used in the processing software.
